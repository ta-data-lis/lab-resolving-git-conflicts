### Rute's bio

Rute doesn't know much about code (yet). She wants to learn Python to do data journalism. She's into radio (yes, that old school music-box-type-of-thing) and open source. She also likes crochet.

She doesn't like conflicts on GitHub, but she kind of knows how to resolve them now.

_Markdown files are pretty cool._
