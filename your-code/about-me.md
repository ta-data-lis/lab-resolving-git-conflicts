I am Filipe from Brazil. I am a manufacturing engineer without any experience with IT or Data. I came to Ironhack to add up new skills to my current carrer. By the end of the course I expect to be able to analyse data from machines and other factory equipaments in order to improve the manufacturing process. I will be looking for a job either at the manufacturing industry as a manufacturing engineer with focus on data analysis or directly as a Data Analyst.
