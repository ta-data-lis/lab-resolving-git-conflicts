NEW BRANCH - MODIFIED TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT, FIXED AFTERWARDS ----

FIlipe is the happiest when he feels like he has contributed to other people's well being, shall that happening through helping a friend out or in a broader context adding value to his workplace and/or colleagues.

The Pharma industry sounded like a great path to follow but as time went by and as Filipe grew both personally and professionally, his goals have changed and his disappointment came along - in the sense that Big Pharma is really mainly a business, and not meant to follow its core purpose of helping people overcoming their diseases and adding quality of life to those in need.

Given this not so sudden desire of change, Data sounded like the best option for him to have options in the immeadiate and long time future; while surfing the wave of innovation, it will be life-changing to be able to provide tools and knowledge for ideas that can hopefully change this world into a better place, while still providing the chance to work in a large variety of areas, such as driving the change in pharmaceutical companies, sports data analysis, or with any of the United Nations agencies.
